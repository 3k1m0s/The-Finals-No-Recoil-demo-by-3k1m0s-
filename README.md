### Simple Usage:
- Start the game normally.  
- Run `The Finals - No Recoil_v0.1-demo.exe`.  
- Press `F9` to open the menu. (You can also use the shortcuts without the menu. The menu is just for a visual interface.)

### Shortcuts:
- `F9` = Opens or closes the interface. (You can leave it open on a second screen if you have one.)  
- `"` Key = Stops the script.  
- `CTRL + "` Keys = Starts the script.  
- `CTRL + TAB` Keys = Switches between Full and Half modes.  
- `Numpad 0` Key = Completely closes the script.  

### Modes:
- **Full:** Strongly controls the gun recoil.  
- **Half:** Moderately controls the gun recoil. (This is designed to be less noticeable, so others won’t suspect you’re using a script. Over time, you may find it more effective.)

### Buttons:
- **Visit GitHub:** Opens the project's GitHub page.  
- **Request the full version:** Link to a survey for the full version.  

### Additional Info:
I made this entirely by myself.  
There is no malware or harmful code inside, and you don't need to turn off your antivirus to run it.  

> **Note:**  
> - *The keys and script work only in The Finals window.*  
> - **This is a demo** and is designed only for the Light character’s M11 weapon.  
> - ***There is no license check or time limit; you can use it as much as you like.***
